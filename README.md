# Toxic-comment-classifier
Recent times, the issue of toxic comment classifications is becoming increasingly crucial, as it jeopardises the numerous prospects provided by online information sharing tools such as social media, blog sites, communities, and so on. This project presents a machine learning strategy to dealing with this challenge by utilising the Apache Spark framework and its capacity to deal with Big Data by utilising the Machine Learning library called MlLib. Our current work is limited to english language. We did two sorts of analyses during the observations. The first was conducted using three classification approaches: KNN, DT, and RFC, and it was discovered that RFC performed the best of the three but could not achieve state-of-the-art classification performance increase. The second one used Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and IDF estimator on data set and performed six independent binary classification tasks using Multinomial logistic regression with apche spark and MlLib.  This demonstrates the finest state-of-the-art increase in classification results, with an average accuracy of 98 % and an average F-score of 0.97.
